//This is a simple program console app I wrote for my wife
//She wasn't sure how to reasonably grade middle school typing speeds
//I wrote this to take in the highest and lowest typing speeds and the grade range she wants
//This allows her to be nicer or more strict
//Then it loops through, allowing her to type in each student's speed and prints out a grade
